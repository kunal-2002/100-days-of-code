/**
 *Problem Statement:    Mahesh got a beautiful array named A as a birthday gift from his beautiful girlfriend 
 		Namratha. There are N positive integers in that array. Mahesh loved the array so much that he started to 
		spend a lot of time on it everyday. One day, he wrote down all possible subsets of the array. Then for each 
		subset, he calculated the sum of elements in that subset and wrote it down on a paper. Unfortunately, Mahesh 
		lost the beautiful array :(. He still has the paper on which he wrote all subset sums. Your task is to rebuild 
		beautiful array A and help the couple stay happy :)
