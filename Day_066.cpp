/**
 *Problem Statement:    Palindromic substrings: Anoop likes strings a lot but he likes palindromic strings more. 
 	Today, Anoop has two strings A and B, each consisting of lower case alphabets.Anoop is eager to know whether 
 	it is possible to choose some non empty strings s1 and s2 where s1 is a substring of A, s2 is a substring of B 
 	such that s1 + s2 is a palindromic string. Here '+' denotes the concatenation between the strings.
