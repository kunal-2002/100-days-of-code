/**
 *Problem Statement:    You have prepared four problems. The difficulty
        levels of the problems are A1?,A2?,A3?,A4? respectively. A
        problem set comprises at least two problems and no two problems
        in a problem set should have the same difficulty level. A
        problem can belong to at most one problem set. Find the maximum
        number of problem sets you can create using the four problems.
