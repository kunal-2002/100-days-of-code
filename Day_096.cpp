/**
 *Problem Statement:    Akhil has many balls of white and black colors. One day, he was
    playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both
    consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the
    form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes
    a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored. Other than these two rows of balls,
    Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create
    another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between
    X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized. Hamming Distance
    between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the
    color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming
    distance between "WBB", "BWB" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors
    in the two strings differ. As there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z,
    Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will
    maximize the above value.
