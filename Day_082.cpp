 *Problem Statement:    You are given N binary strings of length N each. You need to find a binary string of length 
 		N which is different from all of the given strings.Note:A binary string is defined as a string consisting 
		only of '0' and '1'.A string is considered different from another string when they have different lengths, 
		or when they differ in at least one position.
