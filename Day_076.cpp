/**
 *Problem Statement:    You are given N integers. In each step you can choose some K of the remaining numbers and 
 		delete them, if the following condition holds: Let the K numbers you've chosen be a1, a2, a3, ..., aK in 
		sorted order. Then, for each i = K - 1, ai+1 must be greater than or equal to ai * C.You are asked to 
		calculate the maximum number of steps you can possibly make.
