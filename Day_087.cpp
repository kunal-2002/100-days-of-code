/**
 *Problem Statement:    There are N stones in a pond, each having a value Ai? written on it. A frog is at stone 1 
 		and wants to reach stone N. The frog can jump from a stone i to any stone j(j>i). Let d be the length of 
		subarray (i.e. j-i+1), then the energy required for the jump is (d·Ai?)-Aj?. Find the minimum non-negative 
		amount of energy required by the frog to reach the N-th stone.Note: It is possible that the total amount of 
		energy required is negative, in that case, you should print the minimum non-negative value (i.e. 0).
