/**
 *Problem Statement:    Suppose, we have a class A which is the base class and we have a class B which is derived 
 	from class A and we have a class C which is derived from class B, we can access the functions of both class A 
	and class B by creating an object for class C.Hence, this mechanism is called multi-level inheritance. 
	(B inherits A and C inherits B).Create a class called Equilateral which inherits from Isosceles and should have 
	a function such that the output is as given below.
