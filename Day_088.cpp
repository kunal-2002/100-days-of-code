/**
 *Problem Statement:    Blobo2 is in his practical exam. The teacher gave him a permutation A of N integers.The 
 		teacher has allowed Blobo2 to make a certain type of operation on the permutation. In one operation, 
		he can: Apply left shift on the permutation. In other words, he can take the first element of the permutation 
		and move it to the back of the permutation.The teacher has asked Blobo2 to find the lexicographically 
		smallest permutation possible after applying any (possibly zero) number of given operations.Since Blobo2 
		wants to impress his teacher, he decided to perform at most two swaps in addition to the allowed operation.
		Find the lexicographically smallest possible permutation Blobo2 can generate after applying at most two 
		swaps and any number of given operations.
