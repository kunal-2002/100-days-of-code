/**
 *Problem Statement:    You are given an array A of N elements. For any ordered triplet (i,j,k) such that i, j, 
 		and k are pairwise distinct and 1=i,j,k=N, the value of this triplet is (Ai?-Aj?)·Ak?. You need to find the 
		maximum value among all possible ordered triplets.Note: Two ordered triplets (a,b,c) and (d,e,f) are only 
		equal when a=d and b=e and c=f. As an example, (1,2,3) and (2,3,1) are two different ordered triplets.
