/**
 *Problem Statement:    Amit and Feedback: Lots of geeky customers visit our Amit's restaurant everyday. 
 	So, when asked to fill the feedback form, these customers represent the feedback using a binary string 
	(i.e a string that contains only characters '0' and '1'.Now since Amit is not that great in deciphering binary 
	strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad :If the string contains 
	the substring "010" or "101", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary 
	to have both of them as substring.So given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the Amit, 
	the strings are Good or Bad.
