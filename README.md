So, when asked to fill the feedback form, these customers represent the feedback using a binary string (i.e a string that contains only characters '0' and '1'.Now since Amit is not that great in deciphering binary strings, he has decided the following criteria to classify the feedback as Good or Bad :If the string contains the substring "010" or "101", then the feedback is Good, else it is Bad. Note that, to be Good it is not necessary to have both of them as substring.So given some binary strings, you need to output whether according to the Amit, the strings are Good or Bad.</a>

Initially, their widths (from top to bottom) are W1,W2,W3.Arunima strength is S. Whenever she hits a stack of bricks, consider the largest k≥0 such that the sum of widths of the topmost k bricks does not exceed S; the topmost k bricks break and are removed from the stack. Before each hit, Arunima may also decide to reverse the current stack of bricks, with no cost.Find the minimum number of hits Arunima needs in order to break all bricks if she performs the reversals optimally. You are not required to minimize the number of reversals.</a>
