/**
 *Problem Statement:    Given an undirected graph and an integer M. The task is to determine if the graph can be 
 		colored with at most M colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same 
		color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices. Print 1 if it is possible to 
		colour vertices and 0 otherwise.
