/**
 *Problem Statement:    Kulyash is given an integer N. His task is to break N into
    some number of (integer) powers of 2. To achieve this, he can perform the
    following operation several times (possibly, zero): Choose an integer X which he
    already has, and break X into 2 integer parts (Y and Z) such that X=Y+Z. Find the
    minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to accomplish his task.
