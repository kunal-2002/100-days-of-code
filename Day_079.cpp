/**
 *Problem Statement:    You are given a binary string S of length N. You can perform the following operation on S:
 		Pick any set of indices such that no two picked indices are adjacent.Flip the values at the picked indices 
		(i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).For example, consider the string S=1101101.If we pick the indices {1,3,6}, 
		then after flipping the values at picked indices, we will get 1?10?110?1?0111111.Note that we cannot pick 
		the set {2,3,5} since 2 and 3 are adjacent indices.Find the minimum number of operations required to convert 
		all the characters of S to 0.
