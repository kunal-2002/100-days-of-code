/**
 *Problem Statement:    Implement a simple editor. The editor maintains the content of a string S and have two following functions:
        "+ i x": insert a string x into the current string S after the i'th character of the S (we use 1-indexing in this problem). When i equals to 0 it mean we add x at the beginning of S.
        "? i len": Print the sub-string of length len starting at position i'th of S.At the beginning, the editor holds an empty string. 
		There will be Q queries of the two types described above.
